Overview
This application provides an accessible interface to analyze Raman spectroscopy data for the purpose of identifying different COVID-19 strains. Using StreamLit, the app offers a user-friendly environment for researchers and clinicians to input data, visualize results, and gain insights powered by an underlying Python-based machine learning model.

Features
User-friendly Interface: Interactive web application built with StreamLit.
Machine Learning Integration: Uses Python-based ML algorithms to process and classify Raman spectroscopy data.
Data Visualization: Displays analysis results and model outputs in real-time.
Easy Setup: Quick deployment with minimal configuration.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
pip
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/MayhemGOAT/StreamLit.git
cd StreamLit
Install Dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment. For example:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that all necessary packages such as streamlit and any machine learning libraries are installed.

Usage
To launch the web application, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
Replace app.py with the actual name of your main application file if it differs.

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by StreamLit (usually http://localhost:8501).

Project Structure
A sample project structure might look like this:
